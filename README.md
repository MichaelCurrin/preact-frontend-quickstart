# Preact Frontend Quickstart
> Starter template using Preact on the website's frontend - without using Node


## About

The demo site is served using static assets and GitHub Pages. 

The `.nojekyll` file is setup to prevent Jekyll processing. Since Jekyll is no needed here and you could otherwise get errors using JavaScript syntax that looks like Liquid syntax.
